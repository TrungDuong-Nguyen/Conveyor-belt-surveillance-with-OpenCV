## Project objectives 

The goal of this project is to build a system that has following features: 

- Capture the video stream from a camera and count the amount of products appearing in this stream. 

- Show, on the computer screen, the post-processed video with the number of products counted and the counting time on it. 

- Save the informations, including the number of counted products and the counting time, in XML format at the end of each operation. 

- Record the video sequence and image of the products counted when the system works. 

To reach this goal, I will base on two programming libraries: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), and cvBlobsLib. In addition, MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) library is necessary to create a user interface. I will code the core of the system in C/C++. 

Besides, it is very important to have a basic understanding of image processing and computer vision theory. This knowledge allows to decide the suitable approaches to try out in this project. 
 
## Principal tasks  

When finishing this project, I would fulfil the following tasks: 

- Assemble a model of a conveyor belt with a mounted camera. 

- Build a computer vision application that satisfies the functional demands. 

- Create a simple interface to favor the operation and surveillance of the system, and also to ease the data (images, videos, operation-related information generated during its running) revision. 

I will visualize each image processing step with pictures and diagrams. Indeed, process every frame captured by camera is the backbone of this system. Also, I will try to give remarks, comparisons, and evaluations to get a more concrete view of the problem. 

Along the way, I will remind the pixel, color, gray scale definition, and theoretical basis of the used algorithms. 

Due to time limitation, I cannot dive deep into the studying of the theory of computer vision, which is very complicated. Hence, this work focuses much more on practical experimentation rather than on theory aspect.
